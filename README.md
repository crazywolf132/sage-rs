Hey there! Welcome to Sage - your friendly neighborhood Git companion. Think of it as a smart wrapper around Git that helps you streamline your workflow.

## Why Did I Build This? ü§î

Let's be real - Git is powerful, but sometimes its workflow can be streamlined. I built this because:
- I wanted to automate repetitive Git workflows
- Switching contexts between terminal and browser for PR management was tedious
- Merge conflicts were taking up too much of my day
- I knew there had to be a faster way to handle common Git tasks

So I built Sage to make my life easier, and hopefully yours too!

## What Makes Sage Cool? ‚ú®

* **Workflow Automation**: Sage handles common Git operations with smart defaults and built-in best practices.
* **Simple Commands**: Instead of typing `git checkout -b feature/branch && git pull origin main && git push -u origin feature/branch`, just do `sage start feature/branch`. Your fingers will thank you.
* **Time Travel (Kind of)**: A super detailed undo system that lets you track and revert operations with precision.
* **PR Magic**: Create and manage pull requests right from your terminal. No more context-switching to GitHub!
* **Branch Wizardry**: Smart syncing with automatic stash handling and conflict detection.
* **AI Helper** ü§ñ: Optional AI features for commit messages and PR content (needs OpenAI API key).

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Requirements
- Git (obviously!)
- GitHub account for PR features
- OpenSSL development packages:
  - Ubuntu/Debian: `sudo apt-get install pkg-config libssl-dev`
  - Fedora/RHEL: `sudo dnf install openssl-devel`
  - macOS: `brew install openssl@3`
  - Windows: Install OpenSSL via vcpkg or download from [OpenSSL's website](https://www.openssl.org)
  - Arch Linux: `sudo pacman -S openssl`

### Installation Options

1. Quick Install (recommended):
```bash
cargo install sage-rs
```

2. Install directly from GitHub:
```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/crazywolf132/sage-rs.git
```

3. Build from source:
```bash
# First, install OpenSSL development packages (see Requirements above)
git clone https://github.com/crazywolf132/sage-rs.git
cd sage-rs
cargo build --release
./target/release/sage -v
```

4. Verify installation:
```bash
sage --help
sage -v
```

### Installation Troubleshooting üîß

If you encounter OpenSSL-related errors during build:

1. Ensure OpenSSL development packages are installed (see Requirements above)

2. Set OpenSSL environment variables if needed:
```bash
# macOS (when using Homebrew)
export OPENSSL_DIR=$(brew --prefix openssl@3)

# Windows (when using vcpkg)
set OPENSSL_DIR=C:/vcpkg/installed/x64-windows-static
set OPENSSL_STATIC=1

# Linux (if OpenSSL is installed in a non-standard location)
export OPENSSL_DIR=/path/to/openssl
```

3. For cross-compilation on Linux:
```bash
# Install OpenSSL for the target architecture (e.g., ARM64)
sudo dpkg --add-architecture arm64
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libssl-dev:arm64
export PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_CROSS=1
```

If you encounter permission issues during installation, you might need to:

1. Fix cargo target directory permissions:
```bash
# Create cargo directories if they don't exist
mkdir -p ~/.cargo/bin
mkdir -p ~/.cargo/registry

# Fix permissions
chmod 755 ~/.cargo
chmod 755 ~/.cargo/bin
chmod 755 ~/.cargo/registry
```

2. Or specify a different target directory:
```bash
# Set CARGO_TARGET_DIR environment variable
export CARGO_TARGET_DIR=~/.cargo/target
cargo install sage-rs
```

3. If you're still having issues, you can try installing with sudo (not recommended, but sometimes necessary):
```bash
sudo cargo install sage-rs
```

4. If you see "could not find SSL config" errors:
```bash
# On macOS, install certificates
brew install openssl

# On Ubuntu/Debian
sudo apt-get install pkg-config libssl-dev

# On Fedora/RHEL
sudo dnf install openssl-devel

# On Arch Linux
sudo pacman -S openssl
```

## Basic Usage üõ†Ô∏è

### Start a new branch
```bash
sage start feature/awesome-stuff
```
Boom! New branch created, latest updates pulled, and pushed to GitHub. All in one go.

### Commit your masterpiece
```bash
sage commit "Add that thing that does the stuff"
```
Stages and commits everything. No more `git add .` followed by `git commit -m` dance.

### Push it real good
```bash
sage push
```
Pushes your work to origin. If you need --force, Sage will make sure you don't shoot yourself in the foot.

### Oops! (Undo System) üîÑ
```bash
# See what you've been up to
sage undo --history

# Take back that last thing you did
sage undo

# Undo something specific
sage undo --id <operation-id>

# Preview before you undo (safety first!)
sage undo --preview

# Find exactly what you need to undo
sage undo --category commit --group branch
```

### PR stuff made easy
```bash
# Create a PR
sage pr create --title "üöÄ Add awesome feature" --body "Trust me, this is good"

# See what's cooking
sage pr list

# Check out someone's PR
sage pr checkout 42

# See what reviewers are saying
sage pr todos 42

# Merge it in
sage pr merge 42 --method squash
```

## Development Process üõ†Ô∏è

### Versioning

Sage uses [CommitSense](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/commitsense-ai-versioner/) for automated semantic versioning:

- **AI-Powered Analysis**: Uses AI to interpret commit messages and determine version bumps
- **Semantic Versioning**: Automatically suggests `major`, `minor`, or `patch` bumps based on commit content
- **Automated Changelog**: Generates a detailed changelog for each release
- **Conventional Commits**: For manual control, you can use conventional commits format:
  - `feat: ...` for new features (minor version bump)
  - `fix: ...` for bug fixes (patch version bump)
  - `BREAKING CHANGE: ...` or `feat!: ...` for breaking changes (major version bump)
  - `release: ...` to trigger a release build

The GitHub Actions workflow automatically handles versioning based on commit analysis.

## Setting Things Up ‚öôÔ∏è

### Environment Variables
- **`SAGE_GITHUB_TOKEN`** or **`GITHUB_TOKEN`**: Your GitHub token for API access
  - Required scopes: `repo`, `read:org` (for organization repos)
  - See [GitHub Integration Guide](src/gh/README.md) for detailed setup instructions
  - If you have the `gh` CLI installed and authenticated, Sage will automatically use that token!
- `SAGE_CONFIG`: Where to keep your config file
- `SAGE_OPENAI_KEY`: For AI features (totally optional)

### GitHub Authentication
If you encounter GitHub API errors like `Error: Github`, you need to set up authentication:

```bash
# Option 1: Set environment variable (add to your shell profile)
export SAGE_GITHUB_TOKEN=your_github_token

# Option 2: Use GitHub CLI 
gh auth login  # Sage will use this automatically
```

For a complete guide on GitHub authentication, see the [GitHub Integration Guide](src/gh/README.md).

### Quick Config
```bash
# AI Settings
sage config set ai.model gpt-4        # AI model to use
sage config set ai.base_url <url>     # Custom AI API endpoint (optional)

# Git Settings
sage config set git.default_branch main    # Default branch for operations
sage config set git.merge_method squash    # Default PR merge method

# PR Settings
sage config set pr.draft false            # Create PRs as drafts by default
sage config set pr.reviewers user1,user2  # Default PR reviewers
sage config set pr.labels feature,docs    # Default PR labels
```

### Experimental Features üß™
Sage includes experimental features that can enhance your Git workflow. View and manage them with:
```bash
sage config experimental
```

Available experimental features:
- **Reuse Recorded Resolution (rerere)**: Git remembers how you resolved conflicts and automatically reuses those resolutions.
  ```bash
  # Enable globally (all Sage repos)
  sage config set experimental.rerere true
  # Enable for current repo only
  sage config set --local experimental.rerere true
  ```

- **Commit Graph**: Speeds up git log operations in large repositories by maintaining a commit graph.
  ```bash
  sage config set experimental.commit-graph true
  ```

- **File System Monitor**: Significantly improves `git status` performance by using OS-level file monitoring.
  ```bash
  sage config set experimental.fsmonitor true
  ```

- **Git Auto-Maintenance**: Automatically optimizes repository performance with scheduled maintenance tasks:
  - Hourly prefetch to keep your repo up-to-date
  - Automatic loose object cleanup
  - Daily reference packing
  - Incremental repack for optimal storage
  ```
