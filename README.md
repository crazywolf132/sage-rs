Hey there! Welcome to Sage - your friendly neighborhood Git companion. Think of it as a smart wrapper around Git that helps you streamline your workflow.

## Why Did I Build This? ü§î

Let's be real - Git is powerful, but sometimes its workflow can be streamlined. I built this because:
- I wanted to automate repetitive Git workflows
- Switching contexts between terminal and browser for PR management was tedious
- Merge conflicts were taking up too much of my day
- I knew there had to be a faster way to handle common Git tasks

So I built Sage to make my life easier, and hopefully yours too!

## What Makes Sage Cool? ‚ú®

* **Workflow Automation**: Sage handles common Git operations with smart defaults and built-in best practices.
* **Simple Commands**: Instead of typing `git checkout -b feature/branch && git pull origin main && git push -u origin feature/branch`, just do `sage start feature/branch`. Your fingers will thank you.
* **Time Travel (Kind of)**: A super detailed undo system that lets you track and revert operations with precision.
* **PR Magic**: Create and manage pull requests right from your terminal. No more context-switching to GitHub!
* **Branch Wizardry**: Smart syncing with automatic stash handling and conflict detection.
* **AI Helper** ü§ñ: Optional AI features for commit messages and PR content (needs OpenAI API key).

## Getting Started üöÄ

### Requirements
- Go 1.20 or later (required for module support)
- Git (obviously!)
- GitHub account for PR features

### Installation Options

1. Quick Install (recommended):
```bash
go install github.com/crazywolf132/sage@latest
```

2. Build from source:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/crazywolf132/sage.git
cd sage
go build
./sage -v
```

3. Verify installation:
```bash
sage --help
sage -v
```

## Basic Usage üõ†Ô∏è

### Start a new branch
```bash
sage start feature/awesome-stuff
```
Boom! New branch created, latest updates pulled, and pushed to GitHub. All in one go.

### Commit your masterpiece
```bash
sage commit "Add that thing that does the stuff"
```
Stages and commits everything. No more `git add .` followed by `git commit -m` dance.

### Push it real good
```bash
sage push
```
Pushes your work to origin. If you need --force, Sage will make sure you don't shoot yourself in the foot.

### Oops! (Undo System) üîÑ
```bash
# See what you've been up to
sage undo --history

# Take back that last thing you did
sage undo

# Undo something specific
sage undo --id <operation-id>

# Preview before you undo (safety first!)
sage undo --preview

# Find exactly what you need to undo
sage undo --category commit --group branch
```

### PR stuff made easy
```bash
# Create a PR
sage pr create --title "üöÄ Add awesome feature" --body "Trust me, this is good"

# See what's cooking
sage pr list

# Check out someone's PR
sage pr checkout 42

# See what reviewers are saying
sage pr todos 42

# Merge it in
sage pr merge 42 --method squash
```

## Setting Things Up ‚öôÔ∏è

### Environment Variables
- `SAGE_GITHUB_TOKEN` or `GITHUB_TOKEN`: Your GitHub token (if you have the `gh` CLI installed and authenticated, we'll use that automatically!)
  - Required scopes: `repo`, `read:org` (for organization repos)
- `SAGE_CONFIG`: Where to keep your config
- `SAGE_OPENAI_KEY`: For AI features (totally optional)

### Quick Config
```bash
# AI Settings
sage config set ai.model gpt-4        # AI model to use
sage config set ai.base_url <url>     # Custom AI API endpoint (optional)

# Git Settings
sage config set git.default_branch main    # Default branch for operations
sage config set git.merge_method squash    # Default PR merge method

# PR Settings
sage config set pr.draft false            # Create PRs as drafts by default
sage config set pr.reviewers user1,user2  # Default PR reviewers
sage config set pr.labels feature,docs    # Default PR labels
```

### Experimental Features üß™
Sage includes experimental features that can enhance your Git workflow. View and manage them with:
```bash
sage config experimental
```

Available experimental features:
- **Reuse Recorded Resolution (rerere)**: Git remembers how you resolved conflicts and automatically reuses those resolutions.
  ```bash
  # Enable globally (all Sage repos)
  sage config set experimental.rerere true
  # Enable for current repo only
  sage config set --local experimental.rerere true
  ```

- **Commit Graph**: Speeds up git log operations in large repositories by maintaining a commit graph.
  ```bash
  sage config set experimental.commit-graph true
  ```

- **File System Monitor**: Significantly improves `git status` performance by using OS-level file monitoring.
  ```bash
  sage config set experimental.fsmonitor true
  ```

- **Git Auto-Maintenance**: Automatically optimizes repository performance with scheduled maintenance tasks:
  - Hourly prefetch to keep your repo up-to-date
  - Automatic loose object cleanup
  - Daily reference packing
  - Incremental repack for optimal storage
  ```bash
  sage config set experimental.maintenance true
  ```

These features can be enabled globally (for all Sage repositories) or locally (per repository). Use the `--local` flag with `sage config set` to enable features for just the current repository.

### Local Storage
Sage stores its data in `.git/.sage/` in your repository:
- `undo_history.json`: Operation history for the undo system
- `config.toml`: Local repository configuration
These files are stored in your Git directory and are not committed to your repository.

### AI Features & Privacy
When using AI features:
- Commit diffs, messages, and PR content are sent to OpenAI
- Basic API key security (stored in global config only)
- Note: Currently no filtering of sensitive data - use with caution
- Consider reviewing diffs before using AI features

## Technical Details üîß

### Error Handling
- Operations are tracked in the undo system for recovery
- Clear error messages help diagnose issues
- Failed operations can be reverted using the undo system
- State is preserved when possible during errors

### Conflict Resolution
- Automatic stash/unstash of local changes during sync
- Branch synchronization with conflict detection
- Clear reporting of conflicted files
- Status tracking during conflict resolution

### Edge Cases
- Preserves uncommitted changes via stashing
- Basic force push protection with confirmation
- Operation history for recovery
- Handles common Git scenarios

## Where We're At üéØ

Here's what's ready to roll and what we're cooking up:

‚úÖ **Ready to Rock**
- Detailed undo system with operation tracking and selective undo
- GitHub PR management (create, list, checkout, merge)
- Branch synchronization with stash handling
- AI-powered commit messages and PR content
- Conventional commit support
- Branch cleanup with safety checks
- Operation history with filtering and preview

üîÑ **In the Workshop**
- Enhanced conflict resolution tools
- More PR automation features
- Performance optimizations
- Extended documentation
- Submodule support
- Advanced branch scenarios

## Known Limitations
- Currently supports GitHub only (GitLab/Bitbucket planned)
- Large repositories might experience slower undo history loading
- AI features require internet connectivity and OpenAI API key
- No filtering of sensitive data in AI features
- Basic force push protection (confirmation only)
- Limited handling of advanced Git scenarios (submodules, detached HEAD)
- Some edge cases require manual conflict resolution
- PR features require GitHub token with appropriate scopes

## Future Growth üå±

Even though I'm just one person maintaining this right now, I see a lot of potential for Sage:

* **More Git Host Support**: Integrations with GitLab, Bitbucket, or self-hosted Git services.
* **Interactive Conflict Resolution**: Potential for a TUI or guided conflict resolution flow.
* **Plugin System**: Let teams extend Sage with custom commands or checks.
* **Optional Lint/Checks**: Pre-commit hooks, code checks, or commit message style enforcement.

I hope to grow this into a stable, community-driven project where developers can feel more confident in their daily workflows.

## Contributing & Feedback ü§ù

I welcome all issues, ideas, and pull requests. If you run into a bug or have a feature request, please open an issue. This project is something I work on in my spare time, so replies may not be immediate‚Äîbut I'll do my best to keep up.

Some ways you can help:

* **Open an Issue**: Report bugs or suggest improvements.
* **Submit a Pull Request**: If you fix something or add a feature, I'd love to see it.
* **Share Your Workflow**: Hearing how you use Sage (or what's blocking you) helps guide development.
